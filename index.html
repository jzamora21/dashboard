<h1> Re-constructing the memory of the Marqueta</h1>
</div>
  

 <body> Harlem residents remember the old days of the Harlem Market and dream of its future.
</body>
  <p> 
    As you enter the Marqueta, you can smell the rice, beans and chicken coming from Cocotazo restaurant and the chocolate cupcakes
     from Lizzy 's Treats. A little further along is a small store called Maruka Café Galería, where you can admire the colorful paintings and landscapes of Puerto Rican culture.</p>
    
<p> The event took place at La Placita which is an open event space where people can come and sample Latin food, such as empanadas, tostones, and eat one of the popular dishes called 'The Rican" de Cocotazo.

  Harlem Night Market is organized by community groups such as Uptown Grand Central, a non-profit association to help clean up the streets of Harlem; TBO Harlem, a food advocacy group; and Union Settlement,
   a community outreach forum. </p>

  <p> José Calderón, a 51-year-old R&B (Rhythm and Blues) musician, remembers that when he was just 12 years old he would accompany his mother to this market to buy food and juices. He remembers his mother always talking with other families at La Marqueta, listening to salsa in the background. They would go to buy fruit such as mangoes, strawberries, and tomatoes. 
  </p> 
  
  <p> "These events, like the Christmas parties, help to revive a little bit of those memories where people would go to La Marqueta every Saturday to get distracted," Calderon says. 
  La Marqueta has been an important icon in the East Harlem neighborhood since the decade (since the 1930s, or the 1930s). The public market was founded in 1936 by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia as a place for small businesses.
  
  <h2> History of the Market </h2>
  In the mid-1950s, the market was open-air and one could buy foods not found in other bodegas, such as yellowfin tuna fish imported from Puerto Rico, fruits such as mamey sapote, logan and carambola. According to the book "East Harlem Remember" by Christopher Bell, the building had elaborate chandeliers and the Marqueta was a place where the community gathered to dance salsa, taste dishes and
   celebrate Latin culture. </p>

   <h3>In An Uncertain future </h3>

<p> One of the new additions to La Marqueta is the Urban Garden Center, owned by the Gatanas family for more than 57 years. The location has been passed down from generation to generation and is now in the hands of Dimitri Gatanas, 52, who moved his business from 86th Street to La Marqueta, just under a year ago, to be back in his neighborhood where he was born and raised.

"This is my home. My mother was baptized here and my brother still lives here. I was destined to return to the place where my family spent most of their time," said Gatanas whose connection to La Marqueta goes back to his childhood "It's amazing to see where life takes you, my grandfather started this business in the neighborhood and now I'm here running the family business."
   
</p>
<p> Today La Marqueta has shrunk to one block, whereas before it was larger and had more businesses. People would go to buy food, traditional medicines, Latin music recordings, and supplies for spells and curses at La Marqueta, according to a 1994 New York Times report.

Today, rising prices, especially for food, affect both clientele and commercial businesses. According to NYU Furman Center data, in 2021 31.2% of East Harlem residents were living in poverty, compared to 18% of New York residents. 

"I hope someday things will go back to the way they used to be. It's sad to see businesses disappear and unfortunately, mine is not doing very well. There are good days and bad days where not all the customers are going to buy because people just can't afford to buy from local vendors," says Gatanas. 

Arlene Pineda, a local vendor who participated in the Christmas event, says she only sees many merchants on special occasions.  She has a small business selling "mandala" paintings, small paintings that a customer can buy as a gift with a message on the back to give to someone else.

" Now there are fewer vendors due to the increase in inflation. It is sad to see that there is not as much business as before," said Pineda.

  In recent years the market has declined due to ongoing construction on Park Avenue, which disrupts local vendors' businesses. In 2017 the city allocated $25 million to help transform the site into a community-oriented public market, cultural center and workforce development anchor under the Park Ave. viaduct.

<p> "But vendors and people in the community haven't seen the improvements," Gatanas says. </p>

  <p> The market has gone through some hardships, but the value it holds for its vendors hasn't changed.
